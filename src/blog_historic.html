					<p>Good day, dear tourists! My name is Veronica, I'll be your tour guide today. Welcomes you on tour "Lions history."</p>
					<p>Before we start our journey, let me remind you the main stages of the history of our city.</p>
					<p>The first written mention about Lviv was discovered in Galicia-Volyn chronicle. It is dated 1256.</p>
					<p>The founder of the city traditionally considered Prince Daniel Galician. The town was named after his eldest son Leo - Lviv.</p>
					<p>Since 1272, the city became the capital of Galicia and Volyn.</p>
					<p>In 1340, Polish King Casimir III the Great, taking advantage of the death of the last of the princely dynasty George II Boleslav, attacks on the Lions. After that lasts a long struggle for our lands between Poland, Lithuania and Hungary. Victory
						in this struggle celebrated Poland, whose power is finally strengthened in 1387 and lasted almost 4 centuries.</p>
					<p>At the end of XVIII map of Central and Eastern Europe is already more powerful state. And in 1772, as a result of the first partition of Poland, which took place between Russia, Prussia and Austria, part of Western Ukraine is a part of Austria, which
						was later renamed Austro-Hungary. Lviv became the center of one of the Austrian provinces. Thus, almost half a century in the city ruled by the Austrians.</p>
					<p>In 1918, as a result of defeat in World War splits the Austrian State and the map of Europe there are several independent states, including Czechoslovakia, Poland and others.</p>
					<p>Also Ukrainian long hesitation November 1, 1918 in Lviv declare a West Ukrainian National Republic (ZUNR). Lviv became the capital of the state. January 22, 1919 the Act was reunification with the People's Republic of West Ukrainian People's Republic
						(of Kiev cent).</p>
					<p>However, Poles, disagreeing with the Ukrainian independence war against ZUNR start. As a result of this war are defeated Ukrainian and from 1919 to 1939, Lviv again falls under Polish rule. This time only 20 years old.</p>
					<p>September 1, 1939 World War II begins with the German invasion of Poland, September 17, 1939 the Red Army under the German-Soviet Molotov-Ribbentrop passes the eastern borders of Poland. Thus, land in Western Ukraine are part of the Ukrainian Soviet
						Socialist Republic, and Lviv became the regional center of Soviet Ukraine.</p>
					<p>The second phase of the war began on 22 June 1941 with the German attack on the Soviet Union. When regular Soviet troops left the city without a fight left NKVD units conducted mass executions of thousands of political prisoners who were in prison
						in Lviv. After the withdrawal of Soviet troops and the arrival of German, at dawn on June 30 held in Lviv Ukrainian National Assembly, which associate Stepan Bandera - Jaroslav Stetsko Act announced the revival of the Ukrainian state. The city began
						to organize Ukrainian troops and police to create a government. The Germans occupied Lviv June 30 late in the evening and in the early days of July the city administration came Hitler. The Germans quickly figured out that they no independent Ukrainian
						state is not required and conducted arrests among members of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, including Bandera was arrested and Stetsko (across Europe, the Nazis arrested over 300 activists of OUN).</p>
					<p>From June 1941 to July 1944, the city experienced a tragic period of Nazi occupation.</p>
					<p>Since 1991, the city is the center of an independent Ukrainian state.</p>
					<p>The population of the city of about 760,000 residents. Climate city is temperate continental, the average January temperature is -4 degrees, and 18 degrees in July.</p>
					<h3>1. Town Hall</h3>
					<p>And now we come closer to the town hall. The word comes from the German Hall «Rathaus» - building council. The building was the residence of the magistrate of the city and is here placed the city government offices.</p>
					<p>In the Middle Ages in the power exercised Council (Magistrate). The Council made up of the Senate, Board of forty men and benches or court. In the Senate chose the 12 most influential and wealthy patricians who called themselves consuls. Senate actually
						owned all power in the city. This body issued decrees which usually began with the words «Senatus populusque Leopoliensis» (the Senate and the people of the city) - the example of ancient Rome - «Senatus populusque Romanum». Every decree has not
						been canceled within one year and one day become law. To aid the Senate convened council of 40 men who were representatives of the interests of the middle class. All disputes solved in the bench (court), which consisted of 12 lavnykiv led to enter.</p>
					<p>Activity magistrate ruled three mayors youwho performed their functions in sequence, changing every 4 weeks. One mayor appointed royal steward, appointed by the Senate of the second and third elected the entire population of the city, which had city
						rights. It is worth noting that the city had the right, not all who have lived and worked in. Suffrage was not deprived Catholics (Rusyns, Armenians, Jews), women (65% of the population) and all those who had property in the center of the city.</p>
					<p>This is one of the newest buildings on Market Square. Its construction was completed in 1835, you may be interested in why this is such a new city hall building, is it still was not in Lviv City Hall? In fact, at this point at various times there
						were several town halls. The first town hall in Lviv was made of wood and burned in the late XIV century. A predecessor of the modern building there was a tragic story. Its tower collapsed in 1826. Shortly before the committee was convened to investigate
						the nature of the cracks in the hall. It was concluded that the building is in very good condition and needs only minor repairs. While the few stations from Market respected officials calmly discussed the cost of future repairs, city official came
						and said that the town hall tower fell.</p>
					<p>New Town Hall Lviv residents initially did not like. She even called the "great Austrian stove high chimney." Despite its massiveness, the new city hall came into the architectural ensemble of the city and its tower has become a symbol of the city.
						The height of the tower is 65 meters. In 1852 it was set at the clock, which was manufactured at the factory Shtil near Vienna. Dial diameter - 3 m length large arrows - 2.15 meters.</p>
					<p>The entrance to the hall guarded by two lions (1948, Eugene Dzyndra). They hold shields with the arms of the city. Based emblem seal rests Galician princes. The emblem - gate towers, which indicate the defensive power of the city to play the gates
						are raised - it talks about the hospitality of the townspeople, and from intruders entrance guards lion city. Big coat of arms on the facade of the city hall set above: with a small shield emblem support Old Russian warrior lion. Overall, statues
						of lions - an old city tradition. Today in Ukraine there are about 3 thousand sculptures of lions.</p>
					<p>It is possible to see the city with a tower, but you have to overcome more than 300 stairs.</p>
					<p>Now notice the gray, soft decorated rustication, house №14, located opposite the town hall. It is not typical for our city - the winged lion of St. Mark is the entrance to the house. Under his paw open book with the inscription: «Pax tibi, Marce,
						evangelista meus» (Peace to you Mark, my yevanheliste). This emblem of the Venetian Republic was installed on the house by chance. Once there was a Venetian consulate.</p>
					<p>The neighboring house №13 to the 1940s had 12 a number because 13 was considered unlucky number.</p>
					<h3>2. Fountain of Neptune</h3>
					<p>We go with you to the central square of the medieval city - Market Square.</p>
					<p>Old Lions - is primarily the Market Square, the center and focus of social, economic and cultural life. These areas were the focus of many European cities. Lviv Market Square size 142h129 form of 44 houses and town hall in the center. From every
						corner of the square out two perpendicular streets that ended at once urban fortifications that opoyasuvaly medieval city.</p>
					<p>The history of the city is inextricably linked with this relatively small, almost square area. There was a magistrate, palaces and houses of noble citizens, then traded to judge others.</p>
					<p>From the original gothic wooden building, who died in a fire in 1527 remained only sometimes old gothic ground floors and basements as massive and often higher than the next, and in the interiors preserved typical gothic vaults, arches and others.</p>
					<p>After a fire in 1527, Lvov decide to build new buildings of stone and brick, calling them stone buildings. The city rebuilt in the Renaissance that has left its mark on the architectural appearance of the area. To rebuild the city mainly Italian
						architects invited.</p>
					<p>In the Middle Ages (from XIV c.) In Lviv operated normally whereby merchants, craftsmen and doctors were allowed to build buildings on Market Square, having no more than 3 windows on the facade. This was the so-called rule of equal opportunities.
						For each window could be used for workshops, shops, pharmacies or just advertising. These homes have small front width, but vydovzhuyutsya depth of 15-20 meters.</p>
					<p>Those homes in more windows, we see now - is the result of later alterations when this rule is no longer in force. Restructuring of stone buildings was carried out until the early twentieth century.</p>
					<p>Most area in the XVIII century. paving had. They say that when the Austrian Emperor Joseph II came to the city, his carriage drawn by six (shesterykom) horses, the market is mired in the mud. Emperor carried on hands and carriage pulled by oxen.
						Then, landscaped area, zamostyly pavement, in the former municipal wells installed fountains with figures of characters of ancient mythology - Neptune, Diana, Adonis and Amphitrite, who performed the sculptor Gartman Witwer. "To the best works Hartman
						Witwer (1774-1825) include, without certainly four stone made from limestone statue wells on the market - they personified allegory of the Earth (sculpture of Diana and Adonis) and water (sculpture of Neptune and Amphitrite). Runtime market figures
						can delineate years 1810-1814. The first mention of the sources on market figure comes from a 1815 City Council then ordered the inadmissibility sculptures damage during the traditional Ukrainian feast Jordan (initiation of water). "</p>
					<p>Before you statue of Neptune - god of the seas and the streams in Roman mythology. The cult is identified himself with the Greek Poseidon. Neptune, like Poseidon, the ancient sculptors usually portrayed as stern old man with a trident in his hand,
						which he raised sea hvyli.Neptun (lat. Neptunus), in Roman mythology, god of the seas and the streams, clouds and rain, initially - God sources (fluid water). In Greek mythology, it corresponds Poseidon, whose wife is Amphitrite. To prevent drought
						July 23 certainly the feast of Neptune, its respected traders morehody fishermen. The images of Neptune always crown on his head and a trident in his hand. Trident Neptune extracts water from the source of the ground and symbolizes the three ways
						of knowing.</p>
					<p>Since ancient times, the first town hall in Lviv XIV. Noise around the market where there were numerous merchant shops, points of interest and booths to sell various goods; Among them were thousands of merchants from the East, West, South and North.
						Market existed before 1944, offering Lvivites vegetables, fruits, milk, flowers.</p>
					<h3>3. Diana Fountain</h3>
					<p>Note the sculpture of ancient Roman goddess of the hunt Diana. In Greek mythology, Artemis meet her.</p>
					<p>House №10 was built on the site of four middle-class homes in the first half of the XVIII century. Custom Count Sapieha (arch. Meretin Bernard, 1744).</p>
					<p>This palace has its own history. After the partition of Poland it became the residence of Austrian governors. In the late nineteenth century. it houses the Ukrainian organization "Enlightenment", which operated here until 1939. It is often visited
						by Ivan Franko, Lesya Ukrainian, Vasyl Stefanik and other prominent figures of Ukrainian culture. From the balcony of the house the morning of 6/30/1941, the proclaimed Act of the Ukrainian state, which resembles a plaque on the facade.</p>
					<p>Right on the corner of the Russian and Serbian, attracts house with white stone portal decorated with diamond rustication. The house has almost no windows on the ground floor. This is an example of a successful restoration of the building. So look
						gothic buildings. When getting dark, the city guards closed the gates tightly locked doors of houses. Each house was a small fortress. About this severe era one of the Lviv historian wrote: "It was a time when human blood was cheaper than wine,
						such as life - cheaper than a horse." At such times it was dangerous to do the windows on the first floor. They began to appear in the Renaissance.</p>
					<h3>4. Palace Kornyakta</h3>
					<p>Before you one of the most significant monuments of civil architecture of Lviv Renaissance building Kornyakta. Remember I told you about the rule of equal opportunities for construction of building with 3-windowed facade? As often happens, the rules
						are different. The first owner of the buildings - a merchant of Greek origin Konstantin Kornyakt probably the richest citizen of Lviv in the history of the city, has no royal permission to build a 3 - and 6-window palace on the Market Square. Only
						he was granted the privilege.</p>
					<p>The palace was built in 1580 on the remains of stone buildings gothic architect Peter Barbon and Paul Roman.</p>
					<p>Kornyakta House is a real gem of Renaissance architecture in Lviv. All the characteristic features of this style: a clear division between floors, large windows, rustication finish, harmonious proportions - clearly represented in this building.</p>
					<p>Look, please upwards. Crowned building high attic, decorated with sculptures of King and six knights. This attic there are the times when the building belonged to the Polish King Jan III Sobieski (1678).</p>
					<p>In this house in 1686 signed the so-called "eternal peace" between Poland and Muscovy, under which it was legally enshrined division of Ukraine and for many centuries it remained under the rule of different states.</p>
					<p>Now the building houses the Lviv History Museum.</p>
					<p>We will go with you into the courtyard of the palace, where you can enjoy wonderful part of Lviv architecture. In the courtyard is a paid toilet. Login and photographing in the courtyard paid tickets can be purchased in the lobby of the museum.</p>
					<p>The best examples of Renaissance architecture inspired writers to create a beautiful palace courtyard with open tiered galleries are captivating rhythm of arcades supported by Tuscan columns and Doric. Lvovyane call it "Italian" for similarity to
						Renaissance courtyards in Italy. Apart from the purely utilitarian function of the combination of the two buildings, and lighting a huge palace courtyard was another grand room in the open air and a real gem of Renaissance buildings.</p>
					<p>Note the sculpture placed in galleries yard. Most of them are copies world-wide sculptural works. Very interesting is significantly damaged the pillar of shame, which once stood on Market Square. Beside him in the Middle Ages served sentences. Nearby,
						on a copy, we see that it consists of two pieces: the executioner with a sword in his hand,and Themis, the Greek goddess of justice with the blindfold and scales in his hand.</p>
					<p>Interesting is also the interior of the house. On the second floor of preserved state rooms era Jan III Sobieski, which the individual short tour.</p>
					<p>Group comes from the Italian courtyard and stopped before the Black Stone.</p>
					<p></p>
					<h3>5. Black stone house</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>Now look for another gem of Lviv architecture, so-called Black Stone (building №4). It was built in 1577. Kamianytsia stands on the foundations of the ancient gothic house XV. The style of the building - a late Renaissance.</p>
					<p>After building a stone house was the usual gray local sandstone. Imposing black - the result of long-term absorption of a stone kiln dust and smoke, because once the home obihrivaly coal. Unfortunately, during the recent restoration of the house
						in the 90's. Last century stone house was just pomalovana in black.</p>
					<p>Typical for Renaissance rust which covered the entire facade Black stone called diamond because limestone treated like a precious stone. Most Renaissance buildings rusta size decreased with the height of the building. Black stone is one of the few
						Renaissance palaces that are decorated the same size rustication.</p>
					<p>Among the sculptures of the facade, is the figure of St. Martin, who shares his cloak with a beggar.</p>
					<p>Before entering the buildings - an unusually narrow lavytsya. It once sat stone keeper. And in order not sleep, did lavytsyu most inconvenient. Who wants can try.</p>
					<p>Kamianytsia Black and Lorentsovychivska, Anchevskyh critics considered the most valuable monument construction bourgeois Renaissance.</p>
					<p>Kamianytsia built on the site of the ancient medieval buildings at the expense of Russian customs officer lands on Italian about. Chios settled in Lviv - Tommaso de Alberta. Authorship buildings owned by Roman Paul or Peter Barbone. Built on another
						(from 1596) by Jan Lorentsovychem owner, city counselor, merchant and pharmacist, building for years called on Pharmaceutical Lorentsovychiv family.</p>
					<p>Since 1645 it has been owned Lorentsovychiv-law, Martin distinguished Lviv patrician Nicanor Anchevskoho whose expense Kamianytsia Black was reconstructed and rebuilt. During the rebuilding and restoration of 1675-1677's., Held under the guidance
						of architect Martin Gradovsky "good", the facade was rustic decoration, was built Baroque attic and found the figure of St. Stanislaus Kostka, St. John of Dukla, St Luke, St. Martin. During the long years of the Black Kamianytsia changed many owners,
						most recently was a lawyer Emile Royinskyy own funds which in 1911 made another capital restoration; made its architect Edmund Zhyhovych. Finally, in 1926 the community sold stone house m. Lviv, which has designated it for location Historical Museum.
						Lviv, which previously housed in the halls of the archive, and then at the Royal stone with the National Museum. King Jan III.</p>
					<p>In 1929 engineer wawrzyniec dayczak completed restoration work in order to adapt the building to store the museum's collection. September 22, 1929 the day of the inauguration of the Historical Museum of the city.</p>
					<h3>6. Bandinelli Palace</h3>
					<p></p>
					<p>House №2 on the corner - a palace Bandinelli. The Renaissance brought home at the end of the XVI century. Bandinelli House - one of the best examples of late Renaissance in Lviv. The main entrance to the house was originally from the area, and during
						the restoration in 1739 it was moved to a side street. Perhaps because both facades of buildings are equally rich decoration carved portals, window frames. House pilasters reinforced with diamond rustication. Portal Market facade framed by two stone
						columns with filigree carvings "fish scales". Dolphins symbolize success in trade, small windows adorn the first floor.</p>
					<p>Since this house is associated in Lviv opening the first regular mail,that once a week, on Saturdays, correspondence sent to Krakow, Lublin, Warsaw and other cities. Organized its Italian Domenico Montelupo, and in 1629, work address perfected a
						new home owner, merchant Roberto Bandinelli from Tuscany. Settling in Ukraine, he received citizenship, and 1629 - a royal privilege of opening the house address. L'mail couriers once a week is taken away and brought here for correspondence Lviv
						residents from all over Europe. However, these services were quite expensive. Sending only six grams of correspondence, such as Gdansk equal day's pay skilled artisan. Paper was difficult at that time and soon Lviv Council refused such expensive
						services. Bandinelli invested in this business and not small money, in fact, the action of the ruined yoho.Palats Bandinelli experienced dramatic story has in modern times. In the late seventies of the last century found that the house in disrepair.
						Improper repairs Soviet building techniques hurt more than bring benefits. When the city began a community to express a strong protest, the house passed restorers. Even then began to conduct research, and after nearly twenty-six years of repair
						and restoration of the grand opening of the Palace of Bandinelli 28 December 2005.</p>
					<p>Through drawings that have survived from the time played style rooms and even furniture design. Now it placed various exposures, such as an exhibition of historical treasures. In the basement is a museum-mail that plays old interior shows vintage
						postage stamps and envelopes, European newspapers and leaflets.</p>
					<p>Note the fountain with a statue of Adonis. Next it shows the dog and boar killed him.</p>
					<p>Adonis - or even demigod hero in Greek mythology. He was a shepherd and hunter. Adonis was famous for her beauty, he even fell in love goddess of love Aphrodite. But his young life ended tragically, hunting boar killed him.</p>
					<p>The fate of Adonis - is one of the favorite themes of ancient poetry. In a figurative sense Adonis - a very handsome man.</p>
					<h3>7. House of seasons</h3>
					<p>Now move on to the old Armenian quarter.</p>
					<p>Before us - the most interesting building in Armenian Street. It was built in the second half of the eighteenth century. (Rebuilt in the XIX century.). This is a striking example of Lviv Empire. According to its original decor has long been called
						"House of the seasons" or "House of the zodiac."</p>
					<p>The facade of the building, perhaps for the first time in Lviv was shown along with mythological characters, ordinary people. Here you can see the annual cycle farmer: "Plowing" symbolizes spring, "Harvest" - summer, "Harvest" - Fall, "Sledge" -
						winter. In the depiction of the ancient Greek god of agriculture - Kronos. Above, the entire width of the facade - strips of zodiac signs, according signed with dates. Above the capitals of pilasters on the edges of the fourth floor depicts a stork,
						which symbolizes the arrival of spring start and departure - return of winter, among them are mascaron symbolizing the four cardinal winds.</p>
					<p>During sculptures and bas-reliefs - excerpts from the poem Virgil's "Georgics" ( "On farming").</p>
					<p>Go ahead. To the right of us is legendary coffee house "Armenian". Coffee is prepared in Turku on the sand and the old recipe.</p>
						<h3>8. Restaurant-museum "Kerosene lamp"</h3>
					<p>Please note monument inventors kerosene lamps Jan Zehu and Ignatius Lukasiewicz. Parents kerosene lamps "meet" at the entrance to the restaurant: Jan Zeh bronze at the table in front of himself institution and Ignacy Łukasiewicz looks out the window
						of the third floor.</p>
					<p>A history of the invention of kerosene lamp was as follows. In 1853 one of Lviv pharmacy named "Under the Golden Star" (now the street. Copernicus 1), a wily Jewish businessman from Drohobych Abraham Schreiner brought a barrel of oil and agreed with
						pharmacists that they are generous reward will find a way overtake oil in alcohol. Jan Zeh and Ignacy Łukasiewicz of excess earnings have not given up and the whole month of rotten scientific experiments. But their spirits did not manage to put
						out, but they produced during the distillation of kerosene. And invented kerosene, invented and first kerosene lamp. Involved in the work of lamp Lviv tinsmith Adam Bratkovsky improved regulation of device invention wick and glass shell. The lamp
						has become safer, and worked without soot.</p>
					<p>And on July 31 the same year, Lviv City Hospital surgeon Zagorski made the first night emergency operation by the light of kerosene lamps. It was proved that a new lamp is not only safe, but also hygienic.</p>
					<p>Subsequently, the US has been issued 50 patents for numerous devices to the lamp and its improvement. Then in a somewhat modified form lamp large editions were produced in America, and then exported to Europe. That's when oil lamp widely used. While
						it has called "American Lamp". Thus, the city championship in this opening somewhat forgotten.</p>
					<p>And over time kerosene lamp Vitisnuly invented gas and electric svitylnyky.Try floor of the house is restaurant-museum "Kerosene lamp". Inside you can see 200 exhibits lamp kerosene.</p>
					<h3>9. Courtyard of the Armenian Church</h3>
					<p>Continue our tour (go into the courtyard of the restaurant «Mons Pius»). Before you is a house of the former Armenian bank «Mons Pius» (in translation - Mount Grace) (XVII century.). Now in this room is now titled restoran.A pass in the eastern courtyard
						soboru.Vezha Armenian church was built in the late sixteenth century. designed by Peter Krasowski. Directly adjacent to the tower structure of the former Palace of Armenian Archbishops (XVII-XVIII c.). In 1726 in this court established a memorial
						column with the sculpture of St. Christopher, who holds little Jesus on his shoulders (sculptor Kristijan seiners) in memory of the founder of the church restoration in 1723 - the head of the Armenian Court of Christopher Avgustinovich. This saint
						is the patron saint mandrivnykiv.Teper look for unusual for the city in its architecture building of the Armenian Cathedral. Armenian Cathedral of the Dormition of the Virgin was built in the middle of the XIV century. (1356 to 1363) .Pered you

						Lvov came under the power of Austria. While the empire by applicable sanitary standards were transferred to all cemeteries outside the center mista.Hachkar - (virm. "Cross-stone") - the kind of Armenian monuments in the form of a stone stele carved

					<h3>10. Armenian Church </h3>
					<p>You are in front of the main entrance to the Armenian Cathedral. Right and left of the entrance you can see traditional Armenian gravestones carved epitaphs - cross stone, which already are traces of tradition tombstones of Catholics, but those are
						traditionally vertykalno. Pered as we enter the church, I want to tell you a funny story related to this inscription (red table with the name of the temple in three languages). It is written as a proper name of this temple in three languages: Armenian,
						Ukrainian and English. Once there was a group of tourists on trips teenage from Poland. Now Polish schools Ukrainian or Russian language study is very rare, in accordance young Poles often do not know how to look Cyrillic letters. So, some of these
						tourists pointing to an inscription in the Ukrainian language, said something like: "What is complicated Armenian language" .Let`s go temple (go to the shops). You can sit and relax while you, I tell you a little about virmen.Lviv Armenians appeared
						in the second half of the XIII century. at the invitation of Daniel Galician.</p>
					<p>The first wave of mass migration of Armenians to our land linked to attacks on Armenia Tatars in the thirteenth century. In the XIV century. decaying once-thriving Armenian Cilicia state of the population which also moved to Lviv hospitality. The
						latest wave of migration of Armenians to the mid sixteenth century.</p>
					<p>Armenian colony of Old Lviv is one of the largest in Europe, after Venice and Amsterdam.</p>
					<p>Armenians living separate community, headed by the elder stood and Council of Elders, composed of the 12 most prosperous middle class. Armenians have their own social and cultural institutions - courts, schools with instruction in their native language,
						hospital, bank, library.</p>
					<p>Most of the Lviv Armenians were artisans. They were engaged in processing of metals, gold, making shoes and towels. Armenians deserve special attention monetnyky. In Lviv at the time was a little mint, and it worked Armenians as united in the fifteenth
						century. Specialists of the case of Lviv artisans.</p>
					<p>Armenians played an important role in trade with the East. The goods they brought - carpets, silk, cloth, weapons, fruit, pepper, wine - in Lviv named Armenian markets and tsinylysya very high.</p>
					<p>Lviv proverb says that where trade began Greek merchant mourned two Jewish and Armenian came when then crying are two Greeks.</p>
					<p>As for the religious life of the Armenian colony, its center, of course, was the cathedral. When it was the residence of the bishop, who is directly subordinate to the Catholicos of All Armenians is the head of the Armenian Church in Echmiadzin -
						the religious capital of Armenians around the world.</p>
					<p>Now you briefly explain the history of the Armenian Church.</p>
					<p>Preached Christianity in Armenia is Thaddeus and Bartholomew, who are considered the founders of the Church in Armenia. Hence the name of the Christian churches - the Armenian Apostolic Church.</p>
					<p>Traditionally, "and the only State religion of Armenia" Christianity was proclaimed in 301. Thus, Armenia is the first Christian state in the world.</p>
					<p>Armenian Apostolic Church decides 3 First Ecumenical Council, as well as Orthodox and Catholic.</p>
					<p>When in 451 in Chalcedon took place the Fourth Ecumenical Council, Armenia was in ruin because of the war with Persia, and representatives of the Armenian Church could not be present at this council.</p>
					<p>Council of Chalcedon adopted a new virovyznachennya of double (divine and human) nature of Jesus Christ (diofizytstvo) and instead sentenced monofizytstvo (doctrine which asserts the existence of only one divine nature (nature) in Christ).</p>
					<p>Armenians also condemned monofizytstvo but rejected and diofizytstvo. So they took all the statutes not Chalcedon and remained miafizytamy (supporters of the doctrine that asserts the unity of God and human nature of Jesus Christ). Unlike monofizytstva,
						miafizytstvo teaches blending of the two natures in Christ or takeover of one another, but says only their indissoluble unity with full preservation of their properties).</p>
					<p>Today the Catholic Church and most Orthodox are diofizytskymy and Armenian - miafizytskoyu.</p>
					<p>It's about the history of the Armenian Apostolic Church in general, and now talk about the history of the local Armenian church.</p>
					<p>In 1630, the Armenian Church on the territory of Rzeczpospolita (Polish-Lithuanian state) takes the union (union) with the Catholic Church. Terms of the union signed in. Armenian Bishop Nicholas Torosevych publicly acknowledged the power of the Pope.
						Thus arose the Armenian Lviv Archdiocese of the Catholic Church.</p>
					<p>This union in favor of Armenians did not go because it facilitated their assimilation and Polonization. If the first half XVII. Lviv lived more than 2,000 Armenians, then in 1783 they were only 212. At the beginning of the XX century. Armenians in
						Lviv almost was not - Poles remained Polonized Armenian names. You may have noticed that those namohylnyh slabs standing at the entrance to the church labeled, but not Armenian and Polish. This is actually the result of the union and policy Polonization.</p>
					<p>There is a Catholic cathedral character. It prybudovuyut long nave where we are now.</p>
					<p>In 1946 the Soviet government eliminated the Armenian Catholic Church and are no longer occur worship. The building housed the store icons Lviv National Museum. Only in the early 90's. XX century. began service.</p>
					<p>May 18, 2003, when major restoration work ended and celebrated 740 anniversary of the cathedral, the grand opening and dedication of the Cathedral of Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary Armenian Church, which held the Catholicos of All Armenians
						Haryehin II.</p>
					<p>Nowadays Armenian Cathedral again belongs to the Armenian Apostolic Church in Echmiadzin centered.</p>
					<p>Historically, that the Armenian Church has its own characteristics in dogma and ritual that the segment</p>
					<p>In worship and used the Armenian rite davnovirmenska language. In the sacrament of the Eucharist used undiluted wine (unlike Orthodoxy and Catholicism) and unleavened bread (both Roman Catholics). Coat priests and liturgical clothing is very close
						to the Byzantine. Special pieces liturgical dress - a sandal that are taken for a period of prayer and Eucharistic communion. Worship can be accompanied by sound body.</p>
					<p>Armenian priests as Orthodox are allowed to marry.</p>
					<p>Unlike the Byzantine rite, where the altar with closed See iconostasis, Armenian liturgy is open.</p>
					<p>Armenian Apostolic Church celebrates Christmas and Epiphany on January 6 in one day under the name Epiphany.</p>
					<p>Armenian Catholic Church, like the Roman Catholic Church celebrates Christmas on December 25, and separately Epiphany - January 6.</p>
					<p>And now will examine the interior of the church.</p>
					<p>Like many other ancient temples in Europe, the cathedral rebuilt several times, and its original Gothic forms subsequently overgrown Renaissance, Baroque and finally, layers of Art Nouveau - according to the tastes of different ages and generations.</p>
					<p>Interior oldest part of the church many painted ornaments, which are used in typical Armenian motifs, including carved in stone and alabaster image of stylized Armenian Cross. Notice the unique frescoes on the window slopes, right. These fragments
						are the oldest preserved examples of monumental painting in.</p>
					<p>Things religious and secular figures buried in the crypt of the cathedral. Left in the temple remained immured in a wall epitaph Armenian Patriarch Stephen V, who died in Lvov in 1551. Patriarch shown in full growth. Nahrobok is the oldest surviving
						this type of relief in.</p>
					<p>The thing you see epitaph Armenian Archbishop Isaac Isakovich, who played an important role in the life of the Armenian community. It is said that the man was very eloquent, so many people of Lviv bequeathed to it Isakovich delivered a speech at
						their funeral.</p>
					<p>Above the altar is part of the dome, which is decorated with mosaics designed by Józef Mehoffer. It depicts the Holy Trinity.</p>
					<p>On the altar is placed icon of the Virgin with little Jesus. In total, this church is very small icons, which makes it similar to the Catholic church.</p>
					<p>Murals in the modern style to Armenian Cathedral, in the period from 1925 to 1929, executed by artist Jan Henryk Rosen. He demonstrated mastery of drawing and color. Armenian Archbishop Jozef Teodorovich person was controversial among its features
						are extraordinary courage and charisma. He commissioned the painting of the cathedral, although talented, but it is unknown at the time the artist-mysticism. In the end, something incredible happened. Murals Rosen became, if not the most valuable
						part of the building, the most effective precisely.</p>
					<p>At the altar of the church shows the fresco depicting the "Last Supper."</p>
					<p>This story has inspired many famous artists who have tried to portray the spiritual unity of teachers and students and philosophical sadness last joint meeting of the terrible trials that befell Jesus Christ. Rosen depicted in its last meeting of
						Christ with his apostles. If we calculate the apostles, then be surprised that they are eleven. Judas, who betrayed Jesus seems not deserve image artist. Its shape is almost not visible, right, we see only his arm, perhaps the same one that took
						the thirty pieces of silver for betraying the Master. Also interesting feature of this painting is that the clothes of Jesus is much lighter than the clothes of his students.</p>
					<p>Look to the right for the Archbishop's throne is a huge mural that adorns the wall of the ancient temple. On the huge painting "The Crucifixion" Rosen showed the original artistic interpretation of the event, showing Christ is not a martyr, and triumph.
						In addition, he portrayed not only those historical figures that were physically present at the Crucifixion of Christ, but many other people from different ages.</p>
					<p>Left - Lady in blue clothes near a white dress - John the Evangelist. To the left of them is St. Peter dressed in white with a beard, holding a pink block, which depicts a miniature Vatican St. Peter. Near St. Luke, holding the icon of Our Lady of
						Czestochowa. Below in red clothes - a Roman centurion.</p>
					<p>To the right of the Crucified Christ - Holy keeps staff. Benedict, kneeling St. Francis also shown there are other characters.</p>
					<p>On the left wall is a painting "Adoration of the Shepherds of Bethlehem."</p>
					<p>In the church there are two side altars. On the right altar is an icon Gregory the Illuminator, considered the Baptist Armenian people and left - Our Lady Kamenetskoy. During the expulsion of the Armenians by the Turks Kamenetz-Podolsk, Armenians
						have permission export icons of the Armenian church of the city and moved it to a church in Lviv, where it is today.</p>
					<p>As you can see, Armenians are custom to put candles in pisok.Livoruch is the entrance to the chapel "Blessed Sacrament". A niche above the door is a sculpture "Jesus the Good Shepherd" (1925-1927 gg.) Authorship Sofia Rosen, sister painter Jan Henryk
						Rozena.Navkolo niche depicts the holy martyrs Margaret and Barbara (left); Blessed, Dionysius, Panteleimon, Amadiyah and Tsyriyak (top); Eustace, Wit and Erasmus (right) and .Zahadkovoyu is unusual fresco "Beheading of St. John the Baptist." In
						the center of St seen a dead body. John, dressed only in sheep's clothing.</p>
					<p>Mysterious and unusual mural is "Beheading of St. John the Baptist." In the center of St seen a dead body. John, dressed only in sheep's clothing. St. helplessly bent legs, but in the upper part of his body unearthly power joins mystical life. Holy
						angels surrounding the figure of six feet in which the burn, which is also part of a hoax. One of the angels supporting a dead body, the second holding raised row of head of St. John the Baptist. Side shows the figure of St. Elizabeth, mother of
						John the Baptist, surrounded by his students, who with a look of anguish on his face watching the flogging son. On the left side of the composition the third angel holding an ax - a symbol of death and suffering, the fourth has a hand lamp, which
						is a symbol of the spiritual mission of the saint. Two angels are the body of John the Baptist. They have inspired faces that express a premonition of the prophecy of this saint, emphasizing the scene from the New Testament of the "Last Supper"
						on the body of the saint.</p>
					<p>Around the window there are a few paintings left - "Angels separating the wheat from the chaff" from the top - "Harvester puts the ax to the root of the tree" and right - "Angels fight with evil forces."</p>
					<p>Go to the next fresco entitled "The Annunciation".</p>
					<p>It shows how the Archangel Gabriel announces to the Virgin Mary that she will give birth to Jesus.</p>
					<p>Meeting with an angel comes against the background architecture of ancient Jerusalem. Mary's face is full of humility and understanding of their mission. At the bottom of the painting is quoted in Polish from the New Testament, which describes the
						event. The importance of this point emphasizes painted the background scene where Jesus carries the cross to Calvary. Before Christ is a man whose face we can not see, perhaps - is John the Baptist.</p>
					<p>As you can see, the Armenian Church not shunned depict zodiac signs, starry sky (at paintings, we will examine with you yet) constellation, heaven - is the abode of God. However, such motives are rarely found in other churches.</p>
					<p>Around the window shows three prophets - Jeremiah (left), Elias (right) and Ezekiel (above).</p>
					<p>In the painting, which was on another window to the right shows the "Sacrifice of Abraham".</p>
					<p>Now we go to the opposite wall of the church. Directly in front of us - the painting "Burial of St. Odilon. "</p>
					<p>The mural depicts the burial of the Abbot Odilon famous Benedictine monastery of Cluny in (France). Odilon great contribution was the introduction of the concept of "peace of God", which meant cessation of strife in the church holidays and special
						periods. Violation of the "Peace of God" punished with fines that reach the confiscation of property, etc. excommunication. "Peace of God" helped reduce the number of civil wars and economic growth. Using his authority Odilon often acted as an intermediary
						and peacemaker in local conflicts.</p>
					<p>But more Father Odilon known that he began celebration of all the deceased faithful in the Catholic Church.</p>
					<p>This holiday is celebrated on November 2. On this day, Catholics around the world commemorate the deceased members of the family, go to the cemetery to clean the graves, light candles for them, organize common family meal.</p>
					<p>At the same fresco depicts how St. coffin. Odilon three monks are accompanied by Odilon successor in office Abbot - Hugo Klyuniyskoho.</p>
					<p>This allegorical painting shows the fluidity of time. Behind the monk, whose face closed hood and his whole figure symbolizes the past, which left behind. In the middle is the figure of a monk, symbolizing the present. He surprised or peering curiously
						at us. Ahead stepping into the unknown monk who has closed his eyes, he sees his path as all of us do not know our future. Even more mystical give vague outlines of dead shadows that accompany this move, holding candles. For funeral for the young
						guys go, symbolizing the continuity of human life.</p>
					<p>Another feature paintings made by Rosen and his courage undisputed evidence is that it is an image of the holy portretuvav real people or knew personally, or were sympathetic to him or were known. All this led to confusion and conflicting thoughts
						contemporary artist, because before they did not see them well-known people in the guise of saints. According Jan Rosen subjected to very severe criticism.</p>
					<p>Above this fresco is located a few paintings.</p>
					<p>Left - St. unconventional image. George Conqueror, where he wins the snake, but is, instead of sitting on horseback. Miracle during which George killing the dragon (dragon) and save the princess from death described in the Life of St. Great and according
						to most guidelines committed by him after his death. This story is allegorical interpretation: Princess - Church snakes - paganism, that George killing the dragon, rescues Christian Church of pagans.</p>
					<p>Top - big track "Holy auspices." This holiday is Deputy animals. The artist introduced a time when St. Aegis rescues persecuted chamois hunters, substituting their own arm released during the boom. Holy is shown as an old man dressed in a modest
						monastic robes, with an ascetic face. He contrasted young hunters noble origin, many wearing full physical strength, which makes the contrast with the power of the Holy Spirit elder. The painting symbolizes the struggle of physical force with the
						power of the spiritual and the victory of the latter. This impression emphasize posture shown here people: fixed, full of spiritual values posture St. Giles and mobile, poses troubled young hunters. One of them was a proud expression based on the
						bow and is ready to challenge the holy act of another already realized St. Giles and humility pohylyv head, holding hands folded in front of you to prayer. Third, the youngest seems full of uncertainty and confusion, wandering eyes as if looking
						for answers to difficult questions.</p>
					<p>Right - painting, which depicts St. Christopher, carries little Jesus across the river. There is a legend about the life of St. Christopher.</p>
					<p>The simple giant Reprev most powerful ruler sought to join his service. He began to serve the king, but realized that he was afraid of the devil. He offered his services to the devil, but realized that he trembles at the sight of the cross.</p>
					<p>Giant found the holy hermit, and asked him how he can serve Christ. Hermit took him to a dangerous ford the river and said his great height and strength make it an excellent candidate to help people cross the dangerous water. Reprev began to carry
						pilgrims on their back.</p>
					<p>Once he was asked to move across the river a little boy. In the middle of the river, he became so heavy that the giant was afraid, as if they both drowned. The boy told him that he - Christ and brings all the burdens of the world. Then Jesus Repreva
						baptized in the river, and he got his new name - Christopher, meaning "he who carries Christ".</p>
					<p>Turn slightly to the left and I'll show you the painting "Death of St. Catherine of Alexandria. " Holidays patron of philosophers and scientists were murdered fanatical crowd in Alexandria Egypt during the persecution of Christians in 307 year. The
						painting is presented against the background of the sky, symbolizing the infinity of space. The body of a young Christian are two angels whose faces overflowing sadness. Instead, face St. Catherine, shown against a background of golden aureole is
						calm, good, it is no fingerprint death. They say the woman was very beautiful, and the artist Rosen tried to introduce in the female figure.</p>
					<p>Interestingly, the Conqueror of St. George, Giles, Christopher and Catherine Alexandria we learn in large measure because of the "Golden Legend" - the collection of Christian legends and interesting lives of the saints. This collection was compiled
						in 1250-ies. Vorahinskym James, Bishop of Genoa, partly written sources, partly on the basis of oral folk tales. "Golden Legend" - is one of the most popular books of the Middle Ages, the XIV-XVI centuries. stood at the second place in popularity
						after the Bible.</p>
					<p>On both sides of the arch, which is before us posted figures of saints, which are symbols of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit (wisdom, understanding, knowledge, the Council, courage, piety, fear of God) and seven major sins (pride, greed, lust,
						envy, gluttony anger, laziness).</p>
					<p>Go to the exit of the temple. Note the dome, where the painting authorship Anthony Tuha "Christ and his congregation."</p>
					<h3>11. Church of the Transfiguration</h3>
					<p>We went to the Church of the Transfiguration, which is interesting for us that it initially built for Greek Catholics, and was delivered to them later.</p>
					<p>This church was built from 1875 to 1898 in the neoclassical style. Interior decor - one of the richest churches of Lviv. As you can see the interior of the house is not much different from the interior of the Orthodox church. The main streams of
						light come through here pidkupolnyy drum, which has twelve large windows. Between the windows are the figures of the Apostles on high pedestals. They are depicted in the full length of the instrument of his martyrdom or other attributes. The author
						was professor of architecture shapes Leonard Marconi (1892).</p>
					<p>The church was built on the former church of the Most Holy Trinity Trinitarian Fathers, based on surviving walls of the previous church.</p>
					<p>In 1923 for the first time in this church service held in Galicia Ukrainian literary language.In the most recent history of the city is known for the church, which was the first temple, which regained the ownership of Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church
						(UGCC) in 1989 rotsi.Zaraz tell you about the history of the Church and features that distinguish it from other Christian princes of konfesiy. In 988 by Prince Vladimir converted to Christianity in the eastern (Byzantine) traditions as the state
						religion of Kievan Rus. This happened before the Great Church Schism of 1054 divided Christian East and West. Kyiv Metropolis was subject to the Patriarch of Constantinople, however, the Church continued to maintain ties with the Latin West and
						its patriarch - the Pope.</p>
					<p>Despite the fact that between Constantinople and Rome had contradictions Kiev church hierarchy tried to keep Christian unity. For example, sent from Russia participated in the Western Councils of Lyon (1245) and Constance (1418).</p>
					<p>From the XIV century in Moscow emerged strengthened and a new church-state cell. Moscow Metropolis Metropolis separated from older Kiev, declaring its autocephalous, ie government in 1448, and in 1589 this church became a patriarchate.</p>
					<p>While almost the entire territory of Ukraine was part of the Commonwealth. Orthodox clergy and nobility had equal rights with Catholics. Therefore, and due to other historical circumstances, in 1596 the Orthodox Kyiv Metropolitan Michael Rahoza 5
						bishops and 3 archimandrites signed the Brest Union, which recognized the ecclesiastical authority of the Pope, coming thus from the jurisdiction of the Patriarch of Constantinople, but retaining the eastern Christian tradition and its own identity.
						However Uniates as the Orthodox have long been considered full citizens of Catholic Christians and the state.</p>
					<p>The process of implementing the union was not easy. At a time when Orthodox bishops recognized the authority of the Pope, the common people could not understand the reasons for this decision and disagreed with him. Thus, a situation where the priests
						deprived of his flock and the flock without its priests.</p>
					<p>After the adoption of the Union of Brest in 1596 became the Uniate Kiev, and Polotsk archdiocese Pinsk, Lutsk, Vladimir and Chelm diocese. The Union did not receive Lviv and Przemysl diocese. After the death of Bishop Cyril Terletckogo in 1607 Lutsk
						Diocese gradually moved away from the union returned to it in 1702 by Bishop Dionysius Zhabokrytskoho. In 1691 the Uniate to Kiev Metropolis joined Przemysl diocese by Bishop Innocent Vynnytska, and in 1700 joined Lvov diocese by Bishop Joseph Shymlanskaya.</p>
					<p>Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is the only Ukrainian churches having continuous hierarchical succession since the founding of the tenth century. Kyiv Metropolis.</p>
					<p>In 1620, after an internal split among the hierarchy and the faithful of the Kyiv Metropolis, Jerusalem Orthodox Patriarch Teofan III consecrated Metropolitan of Kiev Job Boretsky and six bishops. So reopened Kiev Orthodox Metropolis. So exist simultaneously
						start two Ukrainian churches - the Orthodox and Uniate. In 30-40 years of the XVII century both churches Metropolitan attempts to convene a joint Council and declare the Kyiv Patriarchate failed.</p>
					<p>In 1686 Orthodox Kyivan Metropolia was subordinate to the Moscow Patriarchate and converted into a regular diocese during successive unifikatsiynoyi and tsarist Russification policy.</p>
					<p>After three divisions of the Commonwealth at the end of the XVIII century., Almost all of Ukraine with the exception of Western Ukraine was part of the Russian Empire. Empress Catherine II began the fight against the Uniate Kyivan Metropolis aimed
						at its complete destruction and the subordination of the Russian Orthodox Church. In 1795 he was detained under house arrest, Metropolitan Theodosius Rostotsky, where he was separated from his Metropolis, could contact only true diplomatically.
						The following bishops appointed Russian officials were not recognized by the Pope. At the 1839 Synod on the Church in Polotsk was annexed to the Orthodox Patriarchate of Moscow.</p>
					<p>The longest in the Russian empire Uniate church existed in Kholmshchyna. Thus, Chelm Bishopric lasted until 1871.</p>
					<p>On the part of Ukraine, at the end of the XVIII century. went into the Austrian Uniate church continued to exist and develop. In 1774 Empress Maria Theresa Church changed its name to the "Uniate" to "Greek-Catholic", which is reserved for the Church
						and to the present. Greek Catholic priests were equalized in rights with the Roman Catholic. That same year Maria Theresa opened "Barbareum" - the first Greek Catholic seminary, situated in Vienna, 1783 - General Greek Catholic seminary in Lviv.</p>
					<p>In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Church bishops and priests were direct participants in the political, economic and cultural revival of the Ukrainian people. In particular, the author of music of the anthem Ukraine is a priest Mikhail Verbitsky.</p>
					<p>After the Second World War, the second coming of the Communists in Western Ukraine, in March 1946 in Lviv a pseudo, which was proclaimed the liquidation of the UGCC, significant Since the mid 80s in the Ukraine started the revival of the UGCC. Many
						thousands were pivotal events in Lviv prayer march to the Cathedral of St. George September 17, 1989 demanding the legalization of the UGCC in the Soviet Union and met Pope John Paul II with the head of the Soviet state Mikhail Gorbachev in December
						of the same year. These events gave rise to the revival of the legal structure of the Church, the restoration of monastic life, the return of selected shrines, restoration of spiritual education.</p>
					<p>Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church is one of 22 Eastern Catholic churches, which recognize the authority of the bishop of Rome. The number of his faithful (over 5.5 million), it is the largest in the world with all the Eastern Catholic churches, and
						second only to the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
					<p>
						Now on to ritual and doctrinal peculiarities Church.</p>
					<p>Church is the Catholic Church of the Byzantine Rite. This means that the difference between the Orthodox and Greek Catholic rite is not because they shared ritual.</p>
					<p>The difference between these churches is that Greek Catholics are subject to the Roman throne, and each Orthodox church is subject to its Primate.</p>
					<p>Also, the difference is that Greek Catholics accept such teachings of the Catholic Church, such as about purgatory, Immaculate Conception or Filioque.</p>
					<p>Exit the house and continue our tour. We are now on the streets of Krakow, which led from the Krakow Market Square gate, behind which began the road towards Krakow.</p>
					<h3>12. Liberty Avenue</h3>
					<p>Buildings Opera House and the National Museum were the last chords of the formation of the ensemble of the main street of the city. But its formation began in the 80s of the XVIII century. In the former ramparts was arranged "promenade". The lower
						shafts, namely the name received newly promenade, at first it was quite bizarre mix of high society elegance and small-town provincialism. There were planted trees placed benches, pavilions arranged with coffee and soft drinks. At the same time,
						when there walked gentlemen and ladies of the environment, the city considered themselves the cream, other Lvov, with less pretentious layers, broken trees and benches, hung to dry clothes and drove to graze livestock. The order was given here in
						the second half of the nineteenth century. When here was moved downtown.</p>
					<p>Look across the street shows the reconstructed part of preserved medieval defense wall with renewed "Tower of shopkeepers." Once on the internal wall of the city had about 30 towers.</p>
					<p>Construction on the main avenue especially quickened after the Lions became the capital of the province "Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria" Austrian Empire. "Fathers" of the city - the hereditary nobility and bourgeoisie puffed their income, exposed
						it to show. Customers, followed by architects and above all guided by the desire to keep up with Europe Do Lions like Vienna and other glittering capital.</p>
					<p>Note the cornerstones of this structure. It is the home of the former Galician Savings Bank, built by architect Julian Zakhariyevych Viennese Neo-Renaissance style (1891). Portal structure decorated with curved balcony. At the top of the building
						topped with copper-tiled dome, which is located in front of the sculpture (author - Leonard Marconi) by residents of the city often called the "Lviv statue of Freedom" with similarities to the famous New York statue. But in fact this sculpture entitled
						"Savings" and symbolizes the economic prosperity of our region, as Galician savings bank funded institutions and industrial construction.</p>
					<p>Now this building houses the Museum of Ethnography and Crafts. Especially famous is the Museum of their collections of folk costumes and watches.</p>
					<p>Now pay attention to the building of "Grand Hotel", located next to the Museum of Ethnography. It was built in 1893 designed by E. Hermatnyka. Expressive sculptures facade - the powerful Atlanta, performed the same sculptor as the sculptural group
						"Savings" - Leonard Marconi. "Grand Hotel" one of the first in Ukraine was in 1893, electric lighting.</p>
					<h3>13. Lviv Opera and Ballet of S.Krushelnytska</h3>
					<p>Before us - the building of the Lviv National Opera and Ballet Krushelnytska, the most prominent Ukrainian opera singer.</p>
					<p>The theater building is at an unusual place. After a little more than 100 years ago there flowed a river Poltva.</p>
					<p>In the Middle Ages - it was pretty river flowing through the Lions then floated ship order to reach the Baltic Sea - the Vistula and Western Bug.</p>
					<p>In the XIX century. the river was already very polluted and 1890 Poltva channel on the main avenue was hidden in an underground concrete reservoir.</p>
					<p>In order to build an opera house here, had to also change the river, so that the theater is now like in the peninsula.</p>
					<p>Lviv Opera House, or as it used to be called "Grand Theater" was built from 1897 to 1900 by architect Zygmunt Gorgolewski.</p>
					<p>Note the ornate sculptural decoration facade of the theater, in the style of Viennese Neo-Renaissance. The architect, as if preparing for future viewers of various performances. Below two niches you can see, right - Tragedy sculpture with a dagger
						in his hand and left - Comedy mask. Art, like life, unites the comic and tragic traits.</p>
					<p>On top of the cornice is surrounded by several crown stamp boards. In central attracted the attention of two groups of boy geniuses, holding shields with the arms of the city.</p>
					<p>The attic on the top fringe made of sandstone figure of Lviv muses of Greek sculptors. At the same altitude during cruise sculptures are two bas-reliefs on the ancient theme - "Celebration of Poetry" (left) and "Homer recites his poem" (right).</p>
					<p>Philosophical in content are tambourines inlay - triangle under the roof (sculptor A. Popel). In the center - image of elderly man sitting on the sphinx that associates a wisdom and boy reveals secrets of human existence. He says that human life
						consists of joy and sorrow. Tympanum conventionally divided into two parts. On the right side scenes, symbolizing joy, dancing couple, and the couple who drinks wine, and in the corner - peaceful panther as a symbol of victory over savage culture.
						Left side and covered with sadness: this stage kidnapping a girl and weeping soldier who died for their country on the battlefield, as evidenced symbol of courage and heroism - the eagle, shield and mech.Sporuda built for opera and therefore no
						coincidence crown structure copper sculpture - left genius of Dramatic Arts with a theatrical mask and a dagger in his hand, right - genius Music with a lyre and a laurel wreath on his head. The author reminds us that opera - a synthesis of music
						and drama. Art People always dream of glory, because Gorgolewski the highest point of the theater has put the figure of Fame Palme d'Or, which is the symbol of the highest award for people who have dedicated themselves to the art. These sculptures
						are made Viytovychem.Vidomyy talented Ukrainian Lviv sculptor Antony Mars gynecologist once zaklavsya from friends that the sculpture "Glory", which crowns the pediment Opera has the stomach, which is usually in women in the fourth month of pregnancy.
						To prove the truth of his words, he had to find a model who posed for the sculptor. Assumptions physician confirmed - Lviv "Glory" really is "pregnant" .Proshu you pay attention to the structure of the cornerstones right across the road. Before
						the construction of the Opera musical and dramatic performances took place in the building of the former theater of Count Skarbka. Once it was one of the greatest theater buildings in Europe. During construction of the foundations in the ground
						killed 16 thousand piles of stained oak. Now in this building is Ukrainian Academic Drama Theater. Zankovetskoyi.Budivnytstvo Mary took about three years for the financing of local authorities and ordinary citizens of the city. Over the erection
						and decoration fantastic facilities work best European and Lviv masters M.Herasymovych, T.Popel, P.Viytovych, E.Pech, T.Baronch, A.Popel, Z.Razvadovskyy, S.Reyhan and others.</p>

						colored marble masterpieces unsurpassed artistic painting, sculptural works of numerous elements and interior with gold, which spent more than one kilogram of gold.</p>
					<p>Auditorium resembles a lyre shape and has four levels. It contains about two million visitors. Completes the overall picture of the hall decorative curtain "Parnassus", created by the famous painter of the time Henry Semiradsky. It is said that he
						was working on a unique canvas last years of his life in Rome. But it turned out that customers could not buy back the curtain due to lack of money. Then Semiradsky weighed on noble act and gives this unrivaled scenic theater curtain.</p>
					<p>The grand opening of the Great City Theater took place October 4, 1900, which gathered all the elite of contemporary art and the Delegation of the European theater. That day on the stage premiere of the lyric-drama opera "Janek" V.Zhelenskoho in
