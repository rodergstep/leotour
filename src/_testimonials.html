          <p>&ldquo;This Tour was amazing. We had a very good English speaking guide, with excellent knowledge about Ukrainian history, architecture, traditions, religion etc. We learnt a lot and had a unforgettable time walking through this open air museum. &rdquo;</p>

          <p>&ldquo;This tour was excellent and we were educated by our English speaking guide about very different nations and histories which effected live in this city. The guide was very friendly and we got much more from this tour than we expected. Thank you for this beautiful time.&rdquo;</p>
